- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m I am a Post Doctoral Research Associate at Resource Economics | UMass Amherst (MA). I completed a Ph.D. in Resource Economics & Environmental Informatics at the Department of Forest Resources and Environmental Conservation| Virginia Tech. 

- ðŸ‘€ My research interests are in the fields of Environmental and Natural Resource Economics (ENRE) focusing on Forest conservation, Air and Water quality. Founded on economic theory, I utilize advanced econometrics (Causal Inference, Panel Data, and Time Series) and data science (Python, R, Google Earth Engine, and BigQuery) to address critical applied research topics. At VT, I studied land use policy and its impact on mitigating land conflicts, promoting compliance with forest conservation decrees, and recovering secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon. At UMass, I am working with a team of researchers to develop an Integrated Assessment Model to study and quantify the benefits of water pollution control.
